                <p>The following are a collection of scriptures we personally have found important to the topic of marriage.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="purity">Purity</h2>

<p>&ldquo;Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.&rdquo; - 1 Corinthians 7:1</p>

<p>Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren; The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity. - 1 Timothy 5:1-2</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&rsquo;s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour&rsquo;s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour&rsquo;s.&rdquo; - Exodus 20:17</p>

<p>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, - Galatians 5:19</p>

<p>Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. - 1 Timothy 4:12</p>

<p>Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. - 1 Corinthians 6:18</p>

<p>Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things. - Philippians 4:8</p>

<p>Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. - 2 Timothy 2:22</p>

<p>Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure. - 1 John 3:2-3</p>

<h2 id="faith-in-the-lord">Faith in the Lord</h2>

<p>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. - Genesis 2:20-22</p>

<p>He could have made multiple women and left it up to Adam to date each one.</p>

<p>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. - Ephesians 5:5</p>

<p>If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. If ye love me, keep my commandments. - John 14:14-15</p>

<p>House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD. - Proverbs 19:14</p>

<h2 id="espousal-betrothal">Espousal / Betrothal</h2>

<p>And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. - Deuteronomy 20:7</p>

<p>Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. - Jeremiah 2:2</p>

<p>And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD. - Hosea 2:19-20</p>

<p>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS. - Matthew 1:18-25</p>

<p>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary. - Luke 1:26-38</p>

<p>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. - 2 Corinthians 11:2</p>

<p>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. - Luke 2:4-6</p>

<h2 id="parallels-betrothal-christ-the-church">Parallels - Betrothal &amp; Christ/the Church</h2>

<p>It was considered binding; a divorce was required to annul it.</p>

<p>Matthew 1:18-19 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away [divorce her] privily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was (sometimes) a dowry or gift(s) given by the groom to the bride and/or her father/family; it seemed that it was up to the father to decide if/how much it would be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife. If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins. - Exodus 22:16-17</p>

<p>Acts 20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 6:20 For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There would be a time of preparation/waiting (not a set period of time)&hellip;&rdquo; (preparation for both the man and the lady)</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 20:7 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.</p>

<p>John 14:2-3 In my Father&rsquo;s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</p>

<p>Revelation 19:7-8 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.</p>

<p>Revelation 19:9 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.</p>

<p>John 14:2-3 In my Father&rsquo;s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</p>

<p>John 3:27-29 &ldquo;A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven. &ldquo;You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, &lsquo;I am not the Christ,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;I have been sent before Him.&rsquo; &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Christ gave us an example to follow in his relationship with Israel, and later, the Church:</p>

<p>Jeremiah 2:2 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.</p>

<p>Jeremiah 31:31-33 &ldquo;Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; &ldquo;not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the LORD. &ldquo;But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</p>

<p>Hosea 2:19-20 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the LORD.</p>

<p>Isaiah 62:1-5, 10-12 For Zion&rsquo;s sake I will not keep silent, And for Jerusalem&rsquo;s sake I will not keep quiet, Until her righteousness goes forth like brightness, And her salvation like a torch that is burning. The nations will see your righteousness, And all kings your glory; And you will be called by a new name Which the mouth of the LORD will designate. You will also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, And a royal diadem in the hand of your God. It will no longer be said to you, &ldquo;Forsaken,&rdquo; Nor to your land will it any longer be said, &ldquo;Desolate&rdquo;; But you will be called, &ldquo;My delight is in her,&rdquo; And your land, &ldquo;Married&rdquo;; For the LORD delights in you, And to Him your land will be married. For as a young man marries a virgin, So your sons will marry you; And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, So your God will rejoice over you&hellip;Go through, go through the gates, Clear the way for the people; Build up, build up the highway, Remove the stones, lift up a standard over the peoples. Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say to the daughter of Zion, &ldquo;Lo, your salvation comes; Behold His reward is with Him, and His recompense before Him.&rdquo; And they will call them, &ldquo;The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD&rdquo;; And you will be called, &ldquo;Sought out, a city not forsaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John 3:27-29 A man can receive nothing unless it has been given to him from heaven. &ldquo;You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, &lsquo;I am not the Christ,&rsquo; but, &lsquo;I have been sent before Him.&rsquo; &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. Therefore this joy of mine is fulfilled.</p>

<p>Matthew 22:2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son&hellip;</p>

<p>Matthew 9:15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</p>

<p>Eph 5:25-27 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish. (Additional thought: is this also a picture of the betrothal custom of a &ldquo;baptism&rdquo; or &ldquo;washing&rdquo; &ldquo;cleansing with water&rdquo; before betrothal?)</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 6:20 For you have been bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body.</p>

<p>2 Corinthians 11:2 [Paul speaking] For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.</p>

<p>Romans 7:2 For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man. Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another &ndash; to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God.</p>

<p>John 13:5 Jesus washes the disciples feet (A picture of the betrothal custom of mikvah or washing before the covenant was made?).</p>

<p>Matthew 26:27-29 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&rsquo;s kingdom. (A picture of the betrothal custom of a cup of wine shared between the bride- and groom-to-be when they are covenanting with each other, and the looking forward to the wedding feast?)</p>

<p>Ephesians 1:13-14 In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise, Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory. (A picture of the gift from the groom to the bride, given at the time of betrothal?)</p>
