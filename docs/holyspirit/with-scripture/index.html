                <h1>With Scripture</h1>

                
                  
                

                <p>Nothing God has ever said will contradict His Word - because it is His word. Visions from angels, miracles, the word of the Lord, and everything else must all be aligned with Scripture. The Bible is a sure foundation - but it is not all there is in our walk with the Lord.</p>

<p></p>

<p>When speaking about the endtime we know that many will be deceived, and rather than basing their lives on the truth of Scripture and their relationship with God through the Holy Spirit, they will rely on their own wisdom. In fact, the first words Christ spoke about the endtime warn of false teachers, signs, and miracles.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you. For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many. - Matthew 24:4-5
In fact, the deception will be so strong that even the elect would be deceived if those days were not shortened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect&rsquo;s sake those days shall be shortened. Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. - Matthew 24:22-25</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; - 2 Timothy 4:2-3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cannot be a strong Christian without the word of God from Scripture, the Holy Spirit, and a living relationship and dependence on God to lead you day-by-day. God always speaks through His Word - but that word can come from more than just the Bible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained. - 1 Timothy 4:6</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. - John 3:5</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. - John 4:23-24</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The true balance of the Spirit with the Word, is the balance of the Trinity Itself. You cannot have the Father without the Son, nor the Son without the Spirit, nor the Spirit without the Father. They are One, and we must not create a God that we find comfortable and easy to digest. He (singular and plural) is much too big to confine to a small and comfortable set of rules and doctrines. As soon as you put the Lion of the tribe of Judah in a cage, He will show you just how big He is. The Word was never meant to make God smaller, but to show us the depth and breadth of His love for us and open the doorway into the Kingdom. The visions in Revelation, Ezekiel, Joel and all the other prophets ought to give us a peek at the strangeness of our God, and if you really want to know Him, then it requires His Spirit to lead you into that knowledge.</p>
