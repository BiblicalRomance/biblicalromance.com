      <title>Servant Headship And Submission</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marriage is one of the most attacked institutions God ever created. It was the first covenant that God set up, and it is the picture of Christ and His bride the Church. Marriage is one of the most used language pictures in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Divorce</title>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/married/divorce/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marriage in scripture is a very final thing - this is because the one true marriage is the marriage of Christ and the church. There will never be an end of or divorce in this marriage. Unlike our marriages here on earth, it is eternal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marriage Is Hard</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/married/marriage-is-hard/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2017 16:35:29 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/married/marriage-is-hard/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;All marriages are hard in one of two ways, James 4:1 or Galatians 1:4. These are on two completely different ends of the &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; spectrum. One is hard because of our own pride and selfishness, and one is hard because of sacrifice. One &amp;ldquo;hard&amp;rdquo; yields life, and one death.

      <title>Coveting A Wife</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/coveting-a-wife/</link>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/coveting-a-wife/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ephesians chapter 5 warns us about coveting something God has not given us. This is very important as it prevents us from pursuing other people in relationships God has not called us to.

      <title>Patience In A Relationship</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/patience-in-a-relationship/</link>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/patience-in-a-relationship/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Waiting to be in a relationship seems to be the hardest area of our lives in which to exercise patience. At lot of that probably comes from the God-less worldview we are surrounded with every day. Since the world rejects Christ, they reject His plan for their life, including who they are to marry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No Fear In Love</title>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/no-fear-in-love/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear&amp;rdquo; - 1 John 4:18&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Explicitly and completely trusting God removes the fear we have of missing something.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Evaluating A Potential Spouse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What your love interest is pursuing now, is probably what they will be pursuing after you are married. They may take a break to court you, but after marriage, they will resume their true priorities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following are a collection of scriptures we personally have found important to the topic of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The One</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/the-one/</link>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/the-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one form or another Christians often talk about &amp;ldquo;the one&amp;rdquo; you are supposed to marry. We have this idea of the perfect spouse eternally chosen from the beginning of time. You are responsible for finding them, and when you do, you can finally get married and live happily ever after. Basically, Disney-ology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/david-and-brittany/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to share with you the wonderful story of how God brought Brittany and me together, and how after being betrothed as husband and wife for 8 months, we were married on a beautiful crisp October day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Betrothal</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/betrothal/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Aug 2017 15:43:15 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/betrothal/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The picture of betrothal is one of Christ and His Church. The essence of betrothal is seeking God, trusting that if He has a spouse for us, He will bring them into our lives in His timing. If/when He reveals to us and confirms to us that a certain person is to be our spouse, we can trust His leading, and make a betrothal/marriage commitment without having a trial period of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ladies: What to Look for in a Man</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/what-to-look-for-in-a-man/</link>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/what-to-look-for-in-a-man/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A man should provide for his household, be content and thankful with what God has him doing and not complain, be willing to lead by example, be generous with what he has been given, be consistent in his character and choices (even when no one is watching), be self-controlled and actively resist anger, lust, or any other fleshly desire, attend church, read the bible, and pray often.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I&#39;m interested in someone, now what?</title>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/interested-in-someone/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Am I supposed to spend time with this person in a &amp;ldquo;non-dating&amp;rdquo; way, maybe in a group setting? Should I try to go serve where they are? How do I get to know them better? This might be God’s will, how should I pursue this? What if they are far away?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Problem With Dating</title>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/romance/dating/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dating is not Biblical because it fails in three of the most important aspects of the Christian walk: holiness, faith, and following Christ’s example.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We’ve discussed trusting the Lord with every area of our lives and how God’s Holy Spirit leads us so actively every day. Now it’s time to talk about how we should seek God so we can hear from Him.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>With Scripture</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/holyspirit/with-scripture/</link>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/holyspirit/with-scripture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing God has ever said will contradict His Word - because it is His word. Visions from angels, miracles, the word of the Lord, and everything else must all be aligned with Scripture. The Bible is a sure foundation - but it is not all there is in our walk with the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holy Spirit is Needed</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/holyspirit/needed/</link>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/holyspirit/needed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;God’s Holy Spirit is more important than we realize. Christians acknowledge the dire need we have of instruction from the Bible. However, sometimes we forget the dire need we have of leading and instruction from the Holy Spirit. We cannot pick one over the other; we need them both like we need food and water.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scriptural, Faith-based Romance</title>
      <link>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/about/</link>

      <guid>https://biblicalromance.github.io/biblicalromance.com/about/</guid>
      <description>Biblical Romance is a ministry focused on living a life of faith in Christ. That is, we take faith to the extreme (normal) level found in Scripture. Every area of our lives should be an act of faith in God. Just like Jesus (John 5:19, 8:28, &amp;amp; 12:49).
  Pre-Marriage Teachings While much of the Western church acknowledges the biblical act of selling all we have to give to the poor, denying our flesh, or even dying for the cause of Christ, many still ignore the importance of the Holy Spirit in leading us to marriage.</description>

      <title>Who is God?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite simply put, God is the great &amp;ldquo;I Am&amp;rdquo;. Think of anything good and whole - God is that, in the fullest sense. God is not lacking anything, so He is complete in everything that is needed or good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bible never says, &amp;ldquo;Just figure it out&amp;rdquo;, but we are instructed over and over to &amp;ldquo;trust God&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;wait on the Lord&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;seek God&amp;rdquo;. God is the only completely trustworthy person you will ever know.&lt;/p&gt;
