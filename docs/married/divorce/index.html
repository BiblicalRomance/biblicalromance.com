                <h1>Divorce</h1>

                
                  
                

                <p>Marriage in scripture is a very final thing - this is because the one true marriage is the marriage of Christ and the church. There will never be an end of or divorce in this marriage. Unlike our marriages here on earth, it is eternal.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Our marriages here on earth are a shadow of this marriage and likewise should never end as long as both people are alive. God designed marriage to be an unending relationship that brings two people together into one, &lsquo;til death do us part&rsquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;And he [Jesus] answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female, And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. - Matthew 19:4-6</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are to imitate Christ, as He was long suffering and merciful to His Bride (us) who ultimately could only be saved from our rebellion and sin by Jesus&rsquo; own death and shed blood.</p>

<p>Below is the most concise, Scriptural study on divorce we have ever read, written by Pastor John Piper. We encourage you to study this article.</p>
