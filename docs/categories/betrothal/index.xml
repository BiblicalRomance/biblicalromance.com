      <description>The bible puts relationships in three categories (well four if you count immorality):
 Brother / Sister (see also: Friend &amp;amp; Neighbor) Betrothed (A covenanted romantic relationship) Husband / Wife (Married)  This is quite different from the modern western culture that has add multiple &amp;ldquo;try-before-you-buy&amp;rdquo; relationship categories: &amp;ldquo;dating&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;a couple&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;weâ€™re serious&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;engaged&amp;rdquo;, etc. None of these romantic (but uncovenanted) relationships are valid according to God.
So what does a Biblical &amp;ldquo;Romantic&amp;rdquo; Relationship look like?</description>

      <title>The One</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In one form or another Christians often talk about &amp;ldquo;the one&amp;rdquo; you are supposed to marry. We have this idea of the perfect spouse eternally chosen from the beginning of time. You are responsible for finding them, and when you do, you can finally get married and live happily ever after. Basically, Disney-ology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Betrothal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The picture of betrothal is one of Christ and His Church. The essence of betrothal is seeking God, trusting that if He has a spouse for us, He will bring them into our lives in His timing. If/when He reveals to us and confirms to us that a certain person is to be our spouse, we can trust His leading, and make a betrothal/marriage commitment without having a trial period of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
