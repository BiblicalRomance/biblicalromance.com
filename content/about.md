Biblical Romance is a ministry focused on living a life of faith in Christ. That is, we take faith to the extreme (normal) level found in Scripture. Every area of our lives should be an act of faith in God. Just like Jesus (John 5:19, 8:28, & 12:49).

## Pre-Marriage Teachings

While much of the Western church acknowledges the biblical act of selling all we have to give to the poor, denying our flesh, or even dying for the cause of Christ, many still ignore the importance of the Holy Spirit in leading us to marriage.

We use the biblical example of the betrothal of Christ and the Church to help explain the purpose of God even in our marriages. This is especially important for young people who are often left with nothing more than a "purity checklist" for figuring out who they should marry.

You don't need to figure out who you should marry. You need to ask God.

## Marriage Teachings

As Christ so loved the Church, we ought to love one another. Our marriage teachings are focused on the only lasting marriage - that of Christ and the church.

Contrary to secular, self-centered teachings, the path to a good marriage doesn't start with ourselves. In fact, even having a "good marriage" isn't the priority. Pleasing the Lord is.

By taking our focus off of having a "good marriage" here, and putting it on the Lord Jesus, we are able to actually have a "good marriage" here. We don't love our spouse because of how it benefits us (although it does), we love our spouse because Christ first loved us and commands us to love each other.

The only marriage we want for you is one where you seek and obey God.

## Contact

A life focused on God is meant to be lived with the whole body of Christ. If you would like us to come speak at your church or group, please reach out. We are especially targeting the younger generation that is often given purity rules without a focus on our faith-based relationship in Christ.

We would love to hear from you if you have questions or comments. If you want to know more, or you have Scripture to discuss, or simply found this information useful, then please reach out using the email below.

The only thing that matters to us is what God says about life, because there is no other Author.
