Ephesians chapter 5 warns us about coveting something God has not given us. This is very important as it prevents us from pursuing other people in relationships God has not called us to.

> "For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. - Ephesians 5:5

In fact, Ephesians 5 uses fornication as an example of allowing our own wants and desires to cause us to sin. If we do not trust God, then we can be tempted to date or simply covet someone who is not our spouse.

> "...But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints; - Ephesians 5:3

This is bad because we then not only defraud our brother or sister, but become Idolaters by showing that we are not content with Godâ€™s plan but believe we are wiser than God by choosing our own path and spouse.

> "For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore partakers with them. - Ephesians 5:5-7

Instead of coveting something that is not ours, God has plans for our lives that we should be pursuing. God has more for you to be a part of then you will ever make time for. If you are bored then you need to turn to God and ask Him what He would have you pursue.

> "See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. - Ephesians 5:15-17
Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children; And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour. - Ephesians 5:1-2
