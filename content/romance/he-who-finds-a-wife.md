> "Whoso finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD. - Proverbs 18:22

<!--more-->

At first glance, it seems that this verse teaches that, if we find a wife, God will bless us. However, if this an accurate interpretation, then we can also "find" many other things (including salvation) apart from God. Consider the parable Jesus told of the treasure in the field.

> "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hides, and for joy thereof goeth and sells all that he hath, and buys that field. - Matthew 13:44
Did this man find salvation and the Kingdom of God by himself? No. It would be silly to suppose God’s kingdom can be found solely by man's efforts.

This verse does not teach that we should find a wife without the Lord. God actually directs our steps, and enables us to think and breathe and live. We cannot do anything without the help of the Lord.

> "A man's heart devises his way: but the LORD directs his steps. - Proverbs 16:9

I indeed found a wife, but it was the Lord’s doing.
