The picture of betrothal is one of Christ and His Church. The essence of betrothal is seeking God, trusting that if He has a spouse for us, He will bring them into our lives in His timing. If/when He reveals to us and confirms to us that a certain person is to be our spouse, we can trust His leading, and make a betrothal/marriage commitment without having a trial period of sorts.

Betrothal is really wonderful, God’s plans and ways are best! We sometimes worry that if we follow God’s ways, we might miss out on things, but we only miss out on hollow and temporary pleasures to gain the lasting treasure of glorifying Him, and receiving the joy that comes from being in His presence.

> "...[I]n His presence is fullness of joy; at His right hand are pleasures forevermore." Psalm 16:11

> "... [Jesus said,] I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly." - John 10:10
God not only will lead you to the right spouse, job, or ministry. He literally planned every last second of your life - "even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore." - Luke 12:7

Please remember that betrothal isn’t a checklist of steps to follow. Like most of Scripture, it is a test of our heart and obedience through love for God. We can be tempted to put our faith in a method or checklist, whereas in reality, what God wants is for us to seek Him! Scripture is full of instruction from God in every area we need.

Biblical betrothal isn't children trying to find a spouse. It isn't parents trying to find a spouse for their children. It involves everyone waiting patiently on God. And God's timing is perfect. When it is time for Him to bring your husband or wife into your life, He will. And if we are seeking God, and learning to hear His voice, He will tell us when we are supposed to get married, and to whom.

How we choose to glorify him, by applying God’s commands, is often unique to who He has made us. For example, one person may be married in a church to show their submission to the Lord’s Body - another may have an outdoor wedding to testify of the beauty of the world God formed with His Word. One couple may have known each other for years before God brings them together in marriage, while another may meet only a few years or less before God unites them. However, all of these represent a picture of Christ and his Bride, the Church, to the world. All can represent the gospel in a way that glorifies God.
