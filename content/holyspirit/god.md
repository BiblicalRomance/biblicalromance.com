Quite simply put, God is the great "I Am". Think of anything good and whole - God is that, in the fullest sense. God is not lacking anything, so He is complete in everything that is needed or good.

Has it ever occurred to you, that nothing new has ever occurred to God? That God can’t learn something new? That God doesn’t change His mind as He gets older?

Though God is the source of everything, He is not sin or evil, because that is a failure or distortion of something good. For example, God is Love (1 John 4:8), so God hates murder (1 John 3:14-15). God is life (John 14:6), so God will destroy death (1 Corinthians 15:26). God’s words are truth (John 17:17), so God will never lie (Numbers 23:19).

> "Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men." - 1 Corinthians 1:25

God is not simply full of perfect traits. God is the source of these perfect attributes because He is the creator of all things. Love, Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Goodness, Faithfulness, Self-control, Justice, Mercy, Truthfulness, Righteousness, Holiness, and anything else "good" is part of God’s nature.

>"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. - James 1:17

Let us consider God’s wisdom. God is so wise that nothing anyone can do will ever stop God’s plan. When bad things happen, God does not simply try to make the best of each situation. He foreknows each situation and has it (good or bad) planned to bring Him glory and produce good for those that love Him and are called according to his purpose.

> "And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. - Romans 8:28

> "O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! - Romans 11:33

> "Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: - Isaiah 46:9-10

As interested as we are in human love, dwelling on God’s love often seems trite. Yet there is no other subject in all of creation that can exceed the importance of God’s Love. Scripture says love is even greater than faith (1 Corinthians 13:13).

No one will ever display love for you as lavish as God has. God’s love is worth meditating on. God Who is Creator, sent His only Son to die for His rebellious creation. There is no other act of love that can even begin to compare with this.

Though mankind hates God and rebels against his commands, God chose to show us mercy rather than destroying us and starting over. God choose to sacrifice Himself to show us the greatest act of love there will ever be. Not only that, but then God adopted us to be His very children and be filled with His Spirit and have fellowship with Him.

> "Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. - 1 John 4:10

> "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God. - 1 John 3:1

In our pursuit of a Scriptural path to marriage, perhaps the most relevant attribute of God would be His provision for every need we have in life. From basic needs like food and clothing, to putting people in our lives to shape us, God is always at work. Rather than being "hands-off", God is very much involved in who we marry. After all, He formed their first cell and knows exactly who He created them to be.

However, we shouldn’t seek any of these things. We shouldn’t even seek food and water - our most basic need! Instead, God tells us to trust Him for all these things and focus on Him.

> "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. - Matthew 6:33

Notice, He doesn’t promise that He will give us a husband or wife, or car, or house. He promises to provide us food and clothing. Paul discusses this in one of his epistles when he says, "And having food and raiment let us be therewith content." - 1 Timothy 6:8

We know that God wants to give us good things. Jesus says that just as our earthly parents gave good things to us, how much more will your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? (Matthew 7:11)

So we aren’t promised marriage, but if marriage and a spouse is something we need in our life, then God will undoubtedly provide a spouse.

God did this for us spiritually through the Gospel. God sent Christ to be the head and saviour of His body.

> "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. - Romans 5:8

So who does God say He is, in Scripture?

> "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. - 1 John 4:16

> "He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love. - 1 John 4:8

> "He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. - Deuteronomy 32:4

> "Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations; - Deuteronomy 7:9

> "For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations. - Psalms 100:5

> "O LORD God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty LORD? Your faithfulness also surrounds You. - Psalms 89:8

> "For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth. - Psalms 33:4

> "For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. - Psalms 119:89-90

> "O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth. - Isaiah 25:1

> "It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. - Lamentations 3:22-23

> "But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil. - 2 Thessalonians 3:3

> "If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself. - 2 Timothy 2:13

> "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee. Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about. - Psalms 32:8-10

> "My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. - John 10:27-28

You see, God is not another voice that can give us good counsel. God is the only voice that can give us good counsel. If anyone provides good counsel - it is from the Lord.

> "Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight! - Isaiah 5:21

> "Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. - Proverbs 3:5-7

> "The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way. - Psalms 37:23
American Christianity often applies faith in a self-centered instead of Christ-centered way. We find something (or someone) we want and pray that God will show us if having or pursuing that thing is His will. In other words, we ask God’s opinion about what we have decided we want in our lives.

Real Christianity starts with death to our own desires and life. As Christians, we start by seeking God and asking what He wants us to do today. Along the way, God provides the possessions we need to do his will, and the people to serve with. Seeking God and waiting on Him to provide is living a life of true faith and brings God much glory in the eyes of those watching our lives.


> "Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart. Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass. - Psalms 37:4-5

> "But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. - Hebrews 11:6

Contrary to popular opinion, our earthy wisdom often does have an evil source. Our desires to protect our house, business, and even loved ones from danger can be used by Satan to convince us to try to take control from God so that we can better protect what we value. Look at the example of Peter and his reasonable, common-sense wisdom to keep Jesus from being killed.

> "But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men." - Matthew 16:23

Sometimes normal things everyone would agree are right actually are demonic in origin. Yet, no one would ever say that their thoughts might be influenced by the enemy. This is serious because it shows how much faith we have in our own ideas and wisdom.

> "I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. - John 8:38 … Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. - John 8:44
