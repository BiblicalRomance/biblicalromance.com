The Bible never says, "Just figure it out", but we are instructed over and over to "trust God", "wait on the Lord", and "seek God". God is the only completely trustworthy person you will ever know.

> "Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths. - Proverbs 3:5-6

Most Christians agree with this verse. However, in day-to-day life, most of us don’t live like we believe God is trustworthy. Nowhere is this more evident than our approach to romance.

Even the smartest human has made errors. Even the most trustworthy person has failed at times.

Usually there aren’t many people we will trust to make important decisions for us because we know that they may make mistakes or exercise poor judgement. But somehow, we tend to forget this about ourselves. We generally trust ourselves implicitly.

> "It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man. - Psalms 118:8

There is no one 100% trustworthy except for God. This is a an easy truth to consent too, but a hard one to live by. Most days we trust ourselves more than we trust God.

In some area of our life right now, we are doing what we want to do. We are following a path of our choosing, instead of seeking God’s way and following Him.

We know we are not perfectly wise, but sometimes we just want our own way, and aren’t interested in what God has to say about our situation. Often we don’t believe that God is available, all-capable, willing to guide us, and that He loves us.

> "They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. - Psalms 125:1

### Christ’s Example

Jesus is the best example of a life completely surrendered to God, and trusting in God. He lived by perfect faith and trust in God. He never did anything except what He saw His Father doing and He never spoke except what God told Him.

> "Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. - John 5:19

> "For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. - John 12:49-50

> “Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. - John 14:10


The only way to please God is by faith. The ONLY way is by faith. If you want your love story to please the Lord then you must follow Him as he leads you. You cannot look to God for input and then decide your own path - you must submit to the Lordship of Christ.

Our heart is deceitful above all things. God is trustworthy. Mentally it’s obvious God should have the final say about all area’s of life. it’s another thing to choose to submit to Him in faith.

Freely give up control of your future, your plans, and your relationships to the Lord and let Him show you his perfect design for your life. There is no way you will ever be able to beat God’s plan.

Are you ready to surrender your ideas of romance for God’s great plan?
